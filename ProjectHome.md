This Android mobile phone application alerts Muslims to the prayer time.  The times for the five daily prayers are determined by the position of the sun, for example the noon prayer is established when the sun produces the shortest shadows of the day.  Adhān Alarm algorithmically determines these times based on the latitude, longitude and a few other input parameters.

Adhān Alarm can be downloaded from the Android market.
